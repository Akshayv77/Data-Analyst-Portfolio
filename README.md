This repository contains projects that showcase my skills as a Data Analyst, focusing on extracting insights from raw data, building dashboards, and communicating results effectively to stakeholders. Each project highlights a different area of data analytics, ranging from data cleaning and SQL queries to Python analysis and BI dashboards.

# Movie Data Analysis : 
**Objective**
The goal of this project is to analyze movie-related data (ratings, revenues, popularity, etc.) and extract meaningful insights. The analysis showcases how to:
Handle messy real-world data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Visualize relationships between features.
Derive business-like insights (e.g., factors influencing box office success).

**Skills**
-Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
-Environment: Jupyter Notebook
-Other Tools: Git, VS Code / Jupyter Lab
-Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies

**Key Analysis Performed**
Data Cleaning:
->Handled missing values (e.g., revenue, budget).
->Standardized categorical values.
->Removed duplicates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
->Distribution of ratings, revenues, budgets.
->Correlation analysis (budget vs revenue, rating vs popularity).
->Trend analysis by year.
Visualizations:
->Revenue trends across genres.
->Popularity heatmaps.
->Top-performing directors and actors.

**Insights**
->Higher budgets generally correlate with higher revenues, but ROI varies significantly by genre.
->Certain genres (e.g., Animation, Adventure) tend to dominate top box office collections.
->Audience ratings don’t always align with financial success (critical acclaim ≠ box office hit).

**Future Improvements**
->Add predictive modeling (regression to predict box office revenue).
->Build a Power BI / Tableau dashboard for interactive insights.
->Extend dataset to include streaming platforms for modern trends.
