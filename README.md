## üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze movie-related data (ratings, revenues, popularity, etc.) and extract meaningful insights.  

**Key objectives:**
- Clean and preprocess raw movie data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize relationships between features.
- Derive insights on what factors influence a movie‚Äôs success.
