# üé¨ Movie Portfolio Project ‚Äì Data Analytics

This repository demonstrates my **data analysis skills** using a movie dataset. It covers the full workflow from **data cleaning** to **exploratory analysis** and **visualization** in Python.

## üìå Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze movie-related data (ratings, revenues, popularity, etc.) and extract meaningful insights.  

**Key objectives:**
- Clean and preprocess raw movie data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize relationships between features.
- Derive insights on what factors influence a movie‚Äôs success.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code / Jupyter Lab
- **Data Source:** [Kaggle Movie Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) *(or your dataset link if specific)*

## Key Analysis
### **Data Cleaning:** 
- Filled missing values (e.g., revenue, budget).
- Standardized categorical values.
- Removed duplicates.
### **EDA:** 
- Distribution of ratings, revenues, budgets.
- Correlation analysis (budget vs. revenue, rating vs. popularity).
- Yearly trend analysis.
### **Visualizations:** 
- Revenue by genre.
- Heatmaps of correlations.
- Top directors and actors analysis.

## Insights
- Higher budgets generally correlate with higher revenues, but ROI differs by genre.
- Genres like Animation and Adventure dominate box office success.
- Audience ratings don‚Äôt always align with financial success.

## Next Steps
- Build an interactive Power BI/Tableau dashboard.
- Expand dataset to include modern streaming platforms.
